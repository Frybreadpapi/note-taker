# note-taker
## Description

Why did you build this project? I built this project for people that want to keep track of notes and they do not feel like carrying a notebook/notepad around.
What did you learn? I learned that there is a lot of both front-end and back-end development that goes into making a simple application run smoothly and efficiently.

## Installation

## Usage

You would use this application to help you keep track of previous, present, and future notes.

## Credits

Credits to multiple articles on stack overflow, w3schools, and multiple YouTube videos for helping me get things right when I ran into problems. Some of my peers also helped me out when the articles and videos were not helpful.
